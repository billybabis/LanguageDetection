# LanguageDetection
Simple Python program to predict the language of an inputted sentence
 
Run the languagePrediction.py file to see the n-gram prediction model in action. Type in any sentence and let the algorithm predict
what language it is. The algorithm uses some sample texts of different languages to build a probability model; insert another text file in a 
new lanugage if you would like to test that language as well.
